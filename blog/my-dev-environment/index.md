Recently, my college just got his new Macbook Pro and asking me which tools
I'm using on a daily basis. So I think it would be a good idea to list all
tools that I'm using right now.

I'm also using a Macbook Pro 💻, so many of these tools will be for MacOS, but
most of the CLI tools should be working on any platform.

## ⌨️ Editor

* [Vim](https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim) - My main editor for coding 😎
  (Using MacVim binary) Check out my vimrc setup [here](https://github.com/siwatpru/vimrc)
* [Textmate](https://macromates.com) - A good alternative when I want to use
  a mouse (rarely though)
* [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com) - Open source Markdown editor for MacOS.
  Nice way to get a preview for you Markdown files.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Command Line Tools & Shell

* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) - The missing package manager for macOS 🍺
* [ohmyzsh](http://ohmyz.sh) - Lovin' all that auto complete ❤️ Make your terminal a happy one.
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) - Package manager for node.js Much better than NPM in my opinion.
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io) - An opinionated code formatter for Javascript and many other language.
* [Surge](https://surge.com) - Deploy static web by running only one command. Very good for testing stuff.
* [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) - Create React apps with no build
  configuration.
* [gitmoji-cli](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli) - CLI tool for using emojis on git commits. 🎉
* [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) - Get a full fake REST API with zero coding in
  less than 30 seconds (seriously)
* [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve) - Say goodbye to Python's SimpleHTTPServer. 👋

## 🖥 Tools for MacOS

* [Amphetamine](https://itunes.apple.com/app/amphetamine/id937984704) - Gotta keep your Mac awake!
* [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) - A spotlight replacement. Lighting fast ⚡️ and configurable.
* [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com) - A tool for window control. Ever want that window of your
  to fit the left side of the screen or move it to another display? This one is for those.
* [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com) - A terminal replacement with many cool features.
* [Mosaic](https://www.lightpillar.com/mosaic.html) - Similar to Spectacle, but I'm only use this as
  an alternative when I'm dragging the window around and not using the Spectacle's shortcut.
* [iStatMenu](https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus) - Monitor your Mac right from the menu bar.
* [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com) - Organize your menu bar. Especially useful if
  you also use iStatMenu. 🥂

I will try to keep this list updated as possible. Check out the source code for this post
for each version of this list.
